# Handwritten Digit Recognition and Forgery Detection
A machine learning project that recognizes handwritten digits and detects potential forgeries using a neural network model.

## Project Structure
- simple_train.py - Script for training the digit recognition model
- simple_predict.py- Script for making predictions using the trained model
- streamlit_app.py - Web interface for the application

## Features
- Handwritten digit recognition
- Forgery detection for handwritten digits
- Web-based interface using Streamlit
- Pre-trained model included (not in this repository)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
